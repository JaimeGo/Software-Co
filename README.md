# Software & Co

Ruby on Rails application developed with my group in the "Software Development" course at PUC. 

It is available in Heroku at the following url:

The purpose of the application is to provide an interface for notaries, real state agencies and lawyers to communicate, during the transference of property, and in particular as it relates to deeds.

The other members of the team aside from me, Jaime González, were:

* Ignacio Guridi

* Cristopher Gutiérrez

* Ítalo Contreras
